# Consensus Result

- **consensus proposal approved**: True
- **approval_status**: "conditional approval"
- **rating_tier**: "High Risk"
- **rating_tier_score**: 16
- **confidence_score**: 0.75
- **additional_notes**: The consensus reflects a conditional approval based on the fact that while there are significant risks associated with the vessel 'Serenity', the implementation of adequate risk mitigations is crucial to ensuring the vessel's operability in deep-space environments. Given that two analyses support approval and one indicates severe risks leading to denial, it's recommended that further evaluations be conducted to solidify coverage terms and conditions. The potential premium may need adjustment aligned with comprehensive risk assessments.
